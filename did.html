                        internship. I learned about manipulating existing APIs, overriding them, and utlizing branches
                        in GitHub. Last but not least, the fun time making features with great teammates is something
                        that I will never forget.</p>

                    <p>I was responsible for strategic planning and brand management of IoT/ AI devices and services. My
                        team was in charge of branding
                        <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/lg-thinq" target="_blank">"LG ThinQ"</a> in the Korean market.
                        I participated in LG's first launch of AI speakers, IoT sensors, residential IoT solutions, and
                        robots. While working in LG
                        I was exposed to a lot of latest technologies, which inspired me to dream of becoming a

                    <p>I was able to experience diverse markets in the short 6 months in this consulting group. I
                        consulted with the Seoul Tourism Organization for
                        advertising their events. I was in charge of composing guide manuals for an automotive company.
                        I also got the chance to interview various
                        IT industry professionals to formulate employee evaluation systems.</p>

                    <p>The 3.5 years in Wisconsin was unforgettable. The educational atmosphere and professors who were
                        experts in their field were able to
                        spark my scholarly ambitions. Not only was it a place for education, but also it had a beautiful
                        environment to relax and fantastic food.

                        as a defender, the lead-bass of the choir, and also played bass in a rock band. (I think I liked
                        being a "base" for everything)</p>

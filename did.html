                    <p>I was responsible for strategic planning and brand management of IoT/ AI devices and services. My

                        I participated in LG's first launch of AI speakers, IoT sensors, residential IoT solutions, and
                        robots. While working in LG
                        I was exposed to a lot of latest technologies, which inspired me to dream of becoming a

                        advertising their events. I was in charge of composing guide manuals for an automotive company.
                        I also got the chance to interview various

                    <p>The 3.5 years in Wisconsin was unforgettable. The educational atmosphere and professors who were
                        experts in their field were able to
                        spark my scholarly ambitions. Not only was it a place for education, but also it had a beautiful
                        environment to relax and fantastic food.

                        as a defender, the lead-bass of the choir, and also played bass in a rock band. (I think I liked
                        being a "base" for everything)</p>
